Flexbox promises to save us from the evils of plain CSS (like vertical
alignment).

Well, Flexbox does deliver on that goal. But mastering its new mental model can
be challenging.

So let’s take an animated look at how Flexbox works, so we can use it to build
better layouts.

## The concept

Flexbox’s underlying principle is to make layouts flexible and intuitive.

To accomplish this, it lets containers decide for themselves how to evenly
distribute their children — including their size and the space between them.

This all sounds good in principle. But let’s see what it looks like in practice.

In this article, we’ll dive into the 5 most common Flexbox properties. We’ll
explore what they do, how you can use them, and what their results will actually
look like.

### Property #1: Display: Flex

Here’s our example webpage:

![](./flexbox1.gif)

You have four colored divs of various sizes, held within a grey container div.
As of now, each div has defaulted to . Each square thus takes up the full width
of its line.

In order to get started with Flexbox, you need to make your **container** into a
**flex container**. This is as easy as:

```css
#container {
  display: flex;
}
```

![](./flexbox2.gif)

Not a lot has changed — your divs are displayed inline now, but that’s about it.
But behind the scenes, you’ve done something powerful. **You gave your squares
something called a flex context.**

You can now start to position them within that context, with far less difficulty
than traditional CSS.

### Property #2: Flex Direction

A Flexbox container has two axes: **a main axis** and **a cross axis**, which
default to looking like this:

![](./flexbox3.png)

**By default, items are arranged along the main axis, from left to right**. This
is why your squares defaulted to a horizontal line once you applied `display: flex`.

`flex-direction`, however, let’s you rotate the main axis.

```css
#container {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
}
```

![](./flexbox4.gif)

There’s an important distinction to make here: `flex-direction: column` doesn’t align the squares on the
cross axis instead of the main axis.** It makes the main axis itself go from
horizontal to vertical.**

There are a couple of other options for flex-direction, as well: *row-reverse
*and _column-reverse._

### Property #3: Justify Content

_justify-content_ controls how you align items on the **main axis.**

Here, you’ll dive a bit deeper into the main/cross axis distinction. First,
let’s go back to flex-direction: row.

```css
#container {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: row;
}
```

You have five commands at your disposal to use _justify-content_:

1.  Flex-start
2.  Flex-end
3.  Center
4.  Space-between
5.  Space-around

![](./flexbox6.gif)

Space-around and space-between are the least intuitive. **Space-between gives
equal space between each square, but not between it and the container.**

Space-around puts an equal cushion of space on either side of the square — which
means **the space between the outermost squares and the container is half as
much as the space between two squares** (each square contributing a
non-overlapping equal amount of margin, thus doubling the space).

A final note: remember that** justify-content works along the main-axis**, and
**flex-direction switches the main-axis**. This will be important as you move
to…

### Property #4: Align Items

If you ‘get’ justify-content, align-items will be a breeze.

As justify-content works along the main axis,** align-items applies to the cross
axis.**

![](./flexbox7.png)

Let’s reset our _flex-direction_ to row, so our axes look the same as the above
image.

Then, let’s dive into the align-items commands.

1.  flex-start
2.  flex-end
3.  center
4.  stretch
5.  baseline

The first three are exactly the same as _justify-content_, so nothing too fancy
here.

The next two are a bit different, however.

You have stretch, in which the items take up the entirety of the cross-axis, and
baseline, in which the bottom of the paragraph tags are aligned.

![](./flexbox8.gif)

(Note that for , I had to set the height of the squares to auto. Otherwise the
height property would override the stretch.)

For baseline, be aware that if you take away the paragraph tags, it aligns the
bottom of the squares instead, like so:

![](./flexbox9.png)

To demonstrate the main and cross axes better, let’s combine justify-content and
align-items and see how centering works different for the two flex-direction
commands:

![](./flexbox10.gif)

**With row, the squares are set up along a horizontal main axis. With column,
they fall along a vertical main axis.**

Even if the squares are centered both vertically and horizontally in both cases,
the two are not interchangeable!

### Property #5: Align Self

_Align-self_ allows you to manually manipulate the alignment of one particular
element.

It’s basically overriding _align-items_ for one square. All the properties are
the same, though it defaults to _auto_, in which it follows the _align-items_ of
the container.

```css
#container {
  align-items: flex-start;
}

.square#one {
  align-self: center;
}
// Only square one will be centered.
```

Let’s see what this looks like. You’ll apply _align-self_ to two squares, and
for the rest apply `align-items: center` and `flex-direction: row`.

### Conclusion

Even though we’ve just scratched the surface of Flexbox, these commands should be enough for you to handle most basic alignments — and to vertically align to your heart’s content.
