};

The goal of this article is to write a super basic Lambda function in Go, and then deploy it to AWS.

I like starting off easy when learning new tech, and picking something that feels very manageable. It's easy to layer complexity on top, afterwards: you could take the result of this tutorial and use it to spin up a whole constellation of serverless functions.

But let's start small.

Why use Go? It's fast, concise, and robust, but more than that... every developer I know who uses it, loves it. So let's try it out.

Why use Lambda? It's quick & cheap. For a more detailed take, see [my article on it](/articles/lambda).

Here's what you'll learn in this article:

- how to write a function in Go
- how to integrate Lambda functionality into Go, including handling requests
- how to deploy a function to Lambda (and how to automate this step)
- how to test your Lambda function

Let's get to it.

## The setup

If you haven't already, you need to install Go. Follow the steps [here](https://golang.org/doc/install).

After doing so, I recommend restarting terminal and your code editor, just to ensure everything works right. I'll be using VSCode for this tutorial, and we'll use a couple of its features, but it's not a requirement.

## Hello world

Make a new folder called `go-lambda`. Inside, create a file called `main.go`. Let's start with a super basic hello world function.

Go organizes code into "packages", which are bits of reuseable code. To build an executeable program, we need to define a "main" package.

This is really easy. At the top of `main.go`, put the following:

```go
package main
```

Next, we want to import the `fmt` package, which allows us to do a print statement. Below `package main`, put the following:

```go
import (
  "fmt"
)
```

And lastly, we put our main function:

```go
func main(){
 fmt.Println("Helloooo world!")
}
```

If you run `go run main.go` in your terminal, you should see "Helloooo world!" printed.

Here's the whole file, for reference:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    fmt.Println("Helloooo world!")
}
```

## Integrating Lambda

Next, we want to deploy our Hello World function to AWS, so we can test it out.

To do that, we need to accomplish two things:

1. Integrate the AWS Lambda Go library
2. Add in request handling

Our goal for this section is to have a function hosted on AWS, that responds with "Helloooo world!" when we call it.

Let's start by integrating the AWS Lambda Go library. There's a couple of things we need to do before we integrate it into our code.

In order to use third-party Go libraries, our Go package also neesd to be a **module**. This might be confusing, so here's the difference between the two:

1. A package is an executable program
2. A module is one or many packages with shared dependencies.

Our module will only have one package ("main") and one dependency (the AWS Lambda library). So let's set it up.

From the termina, run:

```bash
go mod init github.com/<YOUR_USERNAME>/go-lambda
```

We initialize our module with a URL. If you don't plan on hosting this on Github, you could use `example.com/whatever`. It doesn't really matter, for our purposes.

Then, install the AWS Lambda library:

```bash
go get github.com/aws/aws-lambda-go/lambda
```

At the end of this step, you should see a couple of new files generated: `go.sum` and `go.mod`. These files track the dependencies of our module.

To start using the AWS package, we can adjust our import statement:

```go
import (
	"context"
	"github.com/aws/aws-lambda-go/lambda"
)
```

We're also importing the `context` package, which will be used to access request metadata (we won't use this for anything, but it's good to know about). Lastly, we drop the `fmt` package, as we don't need it anymore.

## Writing a request handler

Our Lambda requires a custom request handler. This function should return either a result or an error. Here's what it looks like:

```go
func HandleRequest(ctx context.Context) (string, error) {
	return "Helloooo world!", nil
}
```

It takes in the context and returns a string for the result, and `nil` for the error. 

With this in place, we simply modify our `main` function like so:

```go
func main() {
	lambda.Start(HandleRequest)
}
```

When `main` is called, our Lambda function will boot up and await requests, which will be routed to `HandleRequest`.

Okay, let's test it out and deploy it!

## Deploying our code 

A quick note about testing lambdas locally: it seems it is possible and easy to do with AWS SAM, but that would needlessly complicate this tutorial. It's really easy to test lambdas post-deploy, so we'll stick with that.

To deploy our code, we need to do three steps:

1. Build the binary
2. Zip it
3. Upload it to AWS

The first two are easy. Run the following commands:

```bash
GOOS=linux go build main.go
zip function.zip main
```

The first creates a binary intended for the Linux operating system (which AWS uses). The second creates a zipfile called `function.zip`.

For the next step, you'll need a few things:

1. An AWS account
2. The AWS CLI installed and authenticated
3. An IAM role with full Lambda permissions

You can create a free AWS account [here](https://aws.amazon.com/free/). To install the CLI, see [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2.html). 

To log in with your AWS credentials, see [this guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-quickstart.html). The important thing is to create a new IAM role and use the Access Key and Secret Access Key from that role, not the root account. 

To add the proper permissions to your role, see [this guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/lambda-intro-execution-role.html#permissions-executionrole-console), but be sure to include the `AWSLambda_FullAccess` policy (this allows you to not just invoke but also create and modify Lambda functions).

This might be a frustrating experience if you're a total newbie to AWS, but you only have to set the CLI up once.

When all that is done, we can FINALLY upload our Lambda function. Here's the terminal command:

```bash
aws lambda create-function --function-name test-go-function --runtime go1.x --zip-file fileb://function.zip --handler main --role <ROLE_ARN>
```

Your `ROLE_ARN` can be found by opening the role up in the IAM console. It'll look something like `arn:aws:iam::<ROLE_ID>:role/<ROLE_NAME>`.

When this completes, you should get back a bit of JSON. Let's test our function out!

## Testing the function 

Go to the Lambda console in AWS. Click Functions on the lefthand menu, and open up our `test-go-function`.

You should see the Function overview. Below that, open up the 'Test' menu. Click the 'Test' button. You should see "Execution result: succeeded". When you open the 'Details', you should see a return value of "Helloooo world!".

If you didn't, ensure your function was uploaded correctly, or that your code is correct.

Nice! We have a hosted Lambda function written in Go. Let's try making it a little more useful.

## Basic addition

To see how we can work with parameters, let's modify our function to take two numbers and add them together, returning the result as a string.

First, we need to define a `Struct` for our parameters with their types:

```go
type AdditionEvent struct {
	Number1 int `json:"number1"`
	Number2 int `json:"number2"`
}
```

We call this an `AdditionEvent` since it is the result of a request "event" occurring.

Next, we use these numbers in our function:

```go
func HandleRequest(ctx context.Context, numbers AdditionEvent) (string, error) {
	return strconv.Itoa(numbers.Number1 + numbers.Number2), nil
}
```

We access the numbers via the `AdditionEvent`, and convert the result into a string (remember to add `strconv` to our import statement!).

The full code: 

```go
package main

import (
	"context"
	"strconv"

	"github.com/aws/aws-lambda-go/lambda"
)

type AdditionEvent struct {
	Number1 int `json:"number1"`
	Number2 int `json:"number2"`
}

func HandleRequest(ctx context.Context, numbers AdditionEvent) (string, error) {
	return strconv.Itoa(numbers.Number1 + numbers.Number2), nil
}

func main() {
	lambda.Start(HandleRequest)
}
```

Now, we want to update our function. We can do this by running the following three commands:

```bash
GOOS=linux go build main.go
zip function.zip main
aws lambda update-function-code --function-name test-go-function --zip-file fileb://function.zip
```

... but that will get annoying fast, if we want to deploy multiple times.

If you're using VSCode, you can set this up as a default build task. Copy my code [here](https://github.com/scottdomes/go-lambda/blob/main/.vscode/tasks.json) (including the folder path) and then hit `⇧⌘B` to set it up. There's more documentation [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/tasks); the end result is being able to deploy just by pressing `⇧⌘B`.

Whether you set up a task or just ran those commands manually, your function should now be updated. Go to the function page in AWS Lambda, and back to the 'Test' tab. 

If you scroll down, you should see the 'Test event' section. Modify the JSON to look like so:

```json
{
  "number1": 1,
  "number2": 3,
}
```

When you hit the 'Test' button, you should get the result of `4`. Good work!

## Done

Our function doesn't do much at the moment, but you have the basics down now, and can easily extend this function to be part of an actual API. I hope this was a good first experience with Go & Lambda; subscribe to my email list for future articles like this.
