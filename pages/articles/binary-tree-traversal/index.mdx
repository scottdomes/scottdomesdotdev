A common programming interview question is to ask you to traverse a tree. The tree might look something like this, and you're asked to go from node to node in a certain order.

tree

There are many variations on this question. It could be an n-ary tree or a binary tree (we'll discuss the difference). You could have to go through the nodes from top to bottom, or left to right. You could have to do preorder traversal, or postorder, or inorder... oh my.

Don't fret. While there are many variations, with varying levels of difficulty, this question gets a lot simpler when you have the right mental model of how traversal should work. So that's the goal of this article: to give you a clear picture of how to approach traversal questions.

Note that we'll try to approach this in a language-agnostic way; you should be able to apply this mental model to any programming language. For the purpose of examples, I'll alternate between Ruby and JavaScript.

# Types of trees

There are two main types of trees you'll encounter: binary and n-ary.

## Binary trees

Binary trees are composed of nodes that can have zero, one, or two children. No more than two children per node.

The other rule pertains to _subtrees_. The left subtree of a given node, for example, includes its left child, and all its left child's children.

DIAGRAM

The right subtree of a node is its right child, and all the children of its right child.

The rule is that the value of a given node must be _greater_ than any values in its left subtree, and _less_ than any value in its right subtree.

DIAGRAM

In the above diagram, focus in on the node 2. Its left subtree is composed of a single node, with the value of 1. That follows the rule, since 1 is less than 2.

Its right child has the value of 4, and a child with the value of 3. Again, we're following the rule, since both 3 and 4 are greater than 2.

So for any given node, you know that its children on the left side are all going to have smaller values than it, and all its children on the right side are going to have greater values.

## N-ary trees

In a binary tree, each node is limited to two children. With an N-ary tree, you can have different maximum numbers of children, depending on _N_.

For example, a 3-ary tree (AKA ternary tree) means that each node can have a maximum of 3 children. A 156-ary tree means that each node can have up to 156 children.

A binary tree is just a specific type of N-ary tree: a 2-ary tree. But they're very common in interview questions, so it's good to talk about them. One example question is converting an N-ary tree to a binary tree.

# Traversal

The basic definition of traversal is to visit each node in the tree once. How you do so, and in what order, depends on the question. Often, you'll be asked to keep track of each node you visited, in order, and have that be the solution.

There are several types of traversal. Let's start with the simplest one: preorder traversal.

## Preorder traversal

Preorder traversal can apply to any type of N-ary tree (including binary). The rules are simple:

- start with the top node of the tree
- mark that first node as visited
- visit its leftmost child
- mark that node as visited
- visit that node's leftmost child
- mark that node as visited
- repeat until all nodes are visited 

This process is much easier to make sense of with a visualization. Let's start with a simple example:

<BinaryTree tree={[1, null, 2, 3]} traversalMethod="preorder" />

A more complex one:

<BinaryTree tree={[1, null, 2, 3, null, 4, 5, null, 6, 7]} traversalMethod="preorder" />

And one more:

<BinaryTree tree={[1, null, 2, 3, null, 4, 5, null, 6, 7, null, 8, null, null, 9, 10]} traversalMethod="preorder" />

(The source code for these animations include the implementations of each type of traversal, in JavaScript, using the Queue method explained in the "Methods" section below.)

## Inorder traversal

In preorder traversal, we visit the node, then its children from left to right. With inorder traversal, we instead start with the left children first. Let's see this first with a binary tree, where it's simpler:

<BinaryTree tree={[1, null, 3, 2, 4, null, 5, 6]} traversalMethod="inorder" />

To implement this kind of traversal, the simplest approach is to use _recursion_.

Here's the code for applying this to a binary tree:

CODE

We print out the value of the node, and then visit its left child, calling the same function from within itself. If that left child has a left child of its own, we'll call the function on that child; if not, we'll move on to the right child.

For the above tree, here's a list of the function calls, in order:

CODE 

Here's the same approach applied to an N-ary tree. It's very similar, but we just don't know the number of children, so we iterate through all of them:

CODE 



export default ({ children }) => (
  <ArticleLayout meta={meta}>{children}</ArticleLayout>
);
