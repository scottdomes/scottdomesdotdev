Let's say you're dealing with a nested array. You need to perform a transformation on the elements of the inner arrays, but only ones of a certain length (say, 5).

Our code:

```js
const results = [];

array.forEach((item) => {
  if (item > 5) {
    results.push(item / 2);
  }
});
```

This code works fine. You end up with a `results` array that contains exactly what you want.

Here's a slightly more readable version:

```js
const filtered = arrays.filter((array) => array.length > 5);
const transformed = filtered.map(array => )
```
