Imagine going about your day and suddenly encountering a 500 line function. You're given a simple task to add some functionality. Let's say it looks something like this:

```js
const createInvoice = (product) => {
  // hundreds of lines of unrelated code

  let price = 0;

  switch (product.type) {
    case PRODUCT_TYPES.foosballTable:
      price = 233.33;
    case PRODUCT_TYPES.airHockeyTable:
      price = 350.5;
    case PRODUCT_TYPES.poolTable:
      price = 900.99;
    default:
      throw "No price found";
  }

  // hundreds of lines of unrelated code
};
```

Your job is to add a new product type, a ping pong table, with a price of $500.

Here's what the solution might look like:

```js
const createInvoice = (product) => {
  // hundreds of lines of unrelated code

  let price = 0;

  switch (product.type) {
    case PRODUCT_TYPES.foosballTable:
      price = 233.33;
    case PRODUCT_TYPES.airHockeyTable:
      price = 350.5;
    case PRODUCT_TYPES.poolTable:
      price = 900.99;
    case PRODUCT_TYPES.pingPongTable:
      price = 500.0;
    default:
      throw "No price found";
  }

  // hundreds of lines of unrelated code
};
```

Easy enough. You can bang that out in five minutes and go back to daydreaming about your upcoming Mexican vacation.

Except, maybe you shouldn't.

## Creeping complexity

In the above change, our 500 line function has now become a 502 line function.

It's a trivial change, but it has contributed to making that function longer and thus harder to read. In fact, this 500 line function likely evolved from a series of similar small changes.

Slowly but surely, your codebase is getting worse. Which means your team is getting slower and unhappier.

A bit dramatic for two lines of code? Maybe. But imagine your task was to add a whole new 10 line switch statement: would you take the same approach?

## Simpler, first

Here's a simple principle that's hard to follow: every change to the codebase should make it better.

In practice, here's what we might do:

```js
const calculatePrice = (productType) => {
  let price = 0;

  switch (product.type) {
    case PRODUCT_TYPES.foosballTable:
      price = 233.33;
    case PRODUCT_TYPES.airHockeyTable:
      price = 350.5;
    case PRODUCT_TYPES.poolTable:
      price = 900.99;
    case PRODUCT_TYPES.pingPongTable:
      price = 500.0;
    default:
      throw "No price found";
  }

  return price;
};

const createInvoice = (product) => {
  // hundreds of lines of unrelated code

  calculatePrice(product.type);

  // hundreds of lines of unrelated code
};
```

Now, the big function has gotten a little bit smaller. The codebase is a little better.

If everyone takes this approach, this function will continue shrinking. Imagine a perpetually improving codebase.

## Reduce, then increase

Our job as developers is often to *add complexity*. We add new features and functionality to the product, which makes it more complicated.

Constant increasing complexity is how you get tech debt: an intractable mess of code. That's how companies die.

But we can take a more positive approach. Before we add new complexity, we can seek to reduce existing complexity. We can make our codebase a little bit better.

This often makes it easier to add new functionality, as well.

Reduce before you increase.

## The cost

In this case, with this change, your work now takes ten minutes instead of two minutes. But imagine a more difficult situation, where reducing complexity means your work goes from one hour to five hours. Is it worth it?

Well, as with anything, it depends. Is there a strict deadline? Will the product sink or swim based on the quick deployment of this feature? If so, maybe it's time to just get shit done.

But most of the time, that isn't the case. Most of the time, we have some slack to refactor first. The rewards are worth it.

Always aim to reduce complexity.
