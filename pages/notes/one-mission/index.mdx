Thesis of _Team of Teams_: 20th century military models were misaligned with information-age war: with the speed and interconnectivity of modern conflict.

Thesis of _One Mission_: How can large organizations move with the speed and agility of a small team? (1)

Four key drivers: (1)

1. Team members trust each other
2. Team members are bound by a common purpose
3. Team members have a shared consciousness; common understanding of problem set, key info, and next direction
4. Team members follow empowered execution: acting with high autonomy, high accountability

Tribal narratives (_my team is the best at what it does_) help team cohesion, but hurt inter-team collaboration; usually such teams are functional enough, but the organization is fragile (15).

Al-Qaeda in Iraq (AQI) had an "inclusive shared narrative" and a "well-communicated strategic vision." Their fluid operational structure helped spread that narrative and allowed easy collaboration. The US military was "unit-centric" while the AQI was organization-centric. (15)

"We were a strictly ordered machine equal only to the sum of our parts; they were an organic movement." (16)

In response, the Task Force began to adopt an aligning narrative, based on the following equation: _Credibility = Proven Competence + Integrity + Relationships._ (17)

Credibility allows "more speed and decentralized autonomy." (17)

The units already have proven competence + integrity, but were missing relationships with each other. (18)

In earlier centuries, information moved at a max of horseback speed. To organize an army required the resources of the state (to enforce order, train marching patterns, maintain roads). Nation-state armies thus dominated war. Now, with instant communication, "disorganized collections of individuals could disrupt our operations in a non-linear manner." (21)

In a traditional bureaucracy, managers are "information pumps"; they don't produce anything, they just facilitate cooperation between teams "through the limited bureaucratic means available to them." They quickly become the bottleneck. (31-33)

Hayek's Nobel Prize acceptance speech: "To act on the belief that we possess the knowledge and the power which enable us to shape the processes of society entirely to our liking, knowledge which we in fact do not possess, is likely to make us do much harm [...] [man] cannot acquire the full knowledge which would make mastery of the events possible." (38)

Bureaucracies are stable, static; networks are flexible, dynamic. Networks are fast becoming the dominant organizational model, but "they lack central planning and are driven purely by narrative." (38, 40)
