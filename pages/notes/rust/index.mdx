_You can read the Rust book in full [here](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/title-page.html)_.

# Getting Started

You can run `rustup doc` to access the documentation, even when offline.

Make a hello world via the following:

```rust
// main.rs
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, world!");
}
```

Then run:

```bash
rustc main.rs
./main
```

You can run `rustfmt` from the command line to format files. [This](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rust-lang.rust) is a VS Code extension for Rust projects, whereas [this one](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=statiolake.vscode-rustfmt) works for single files.

_Macros_ are invoked like `println!("Hello world!")` whereas functions are invoked without the exclamation mark. More on those later.

Rust is a compiled language, which means you compile a binary that anyone can then run (even without Rust installed). Running is thus two steps: compiling and running, vs how it is one step for dynamic languages like JavaScript, Ruby.

Cargo is Rust's build system and package manager. Its config file is written in TOML, which stands for Tom's Obvious, Minimal Language. Great name.

Best practice is to initialize a new Rust project via `cargo new my_project`.

To build a cargo project, run the following:

```bash
cargo build
./target/debug/my_project
```

Or you can just use:

```bash
cargo run
```

If you want to just see if it compiles correctly, run:

```bash
cargo check
```

To make an optimized release build, run:

```bash
cargo build --release
```

# Programming a guessing game

To import a package (in this case the `io` package from the standard library), use:

```rust
use std::io;
```

Certain parts of the standard library are always imported, and known as [the prelude](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/prelude/index.html).

Rust variables are immutable by default (nice). To make one:

```rust
let foo = 5;
```

Make it mutable:

```rust
let mut foo = 5;
```

In the below code:

```rust
let mut string = String::new();
```

... we're calling the `new` associated function on the String type. An associated function belongs to a type, not an instance. AKA a static method.

Many functions can return a `Result` type. `Result` types are enums, with either the value of `Ok` or `Err`.

If you want an `Err` Result to crash your program with a useful message, you can use `expect`. Here's an example of reading the user's CLI and showing a message on a failure:

```rust
io::stdin()
    .read_line(&mut guess)
    .expect("Failed to read line");
```

(`&mut guess` is declaring a mutable reference. More on those later.)

Unhandled Results will result in a warning at compile time. (`expect` isn't really "handling" the error, per se, but it will suppress the warning; if you write `expect`, you want the program to crash when the `Result` is wrong.)

You can do string interpolation like so:

```rust
let x = 5;
let y = 10;

println!("x = {} and y = {}", x, y);
```

Rust calls packages "crates". Your project is a "binary crate"; it's meant to be executed. Packages you use in your project are "library crates"; they're meant to be used by other programs.

To add a dependency, modify `Cargo.toml` like so:

```toml
[dependencies]
rand = "0.5.5"
```

You can view crates via [Crates.io](https://crates.io/).

Your crate versions will stay the same thanks to `Cargo.lock`. To upgrade all your packages, run `cargo update`. Note that this will only upgrade minor version. `0.5.5` will become `0.5.6`, but never `0.6.0`; you have to manually upgrade to `0.6.0` via `Cargo.toml`.

Here's another example of importing and using a crate:

```rust
use rand::Rng;

let secret_number = rand::thread_rng().gen_range(1, 101);
```

We import the `Rng` trait of the `rand` crate; that must be in scope to allow us to use methods related to random number generators. We then call the `rng::thread_rng` function that gives us a random number generator that is local to the current thread. Then we call its `gen_range` method.

To see documentation for YOUR dependencies, run `cargo doc --open`. Pretty neat.

The `cmp` method can be used to compare two things, for example:

```rust
"abc".cmp("cde")
```

The result of a `cmp` will be variant of the `Ordering` enum (imported with `use std::cmp::Ordering`). The variants are `Less`, `Equal`, and `Greater`.

You can combine the `Ordering` enum with a `match` statement. A `match` statement decides what to do based on which variant is returned. Here's an example:

```rust
match "abc".cmp("abc") {
    Ordering::Less => println!("Smaller!"),
    Ordering::Greater => println!("Bigger!"),
    Ordering::Equal => println!("Equal!"),
}
```

`match` checks each "arm" and sees if the returned variant matches; if yes, it executes that code. Here, it would print "Equal!" In the next code snippet, it would print "Smaller!"

```rust
match 1.cmp(&2) {
    Ordering::Less => println!("Smaller!"),
    Ordering::Greater => println!("Bigger!"),
    Ordering::Equal => println!("Equal!"),
}
```

(The `&` is due to 2 needing to be a reference; more on that later.)

Rust is strongly typed, with type inference. In the below code, Rust is smart enough to guess the variable is a string:

```rust
let mut guess = String::new();
```

Here's an example of converting one type to another. Say that `guess` ends up being a number in string form, like `'23'`. We can convert it to a 32-bit number type like so:

```rust
let guess: u32 = guess.trim().parse().expect("Please type a number!");
```

We trim the whitespace, parse the number, and throw a descriptive error if that fails. We also clearly declare the type of the variable. If we didn't specify `u32`, Rust wouldn't know what kind of number to return from `parse()`.

To create an infinite loop, enclose code in a `loop {}`. You can then use `break` to escape it.

To properly handle errors, you can move from an `expect` call to a `match` expression. Here's an example:

```rust
let guess: u32 = match guess.trim().parse() {
    Ok(num) => num,
    Err(_) => continue,
};
```

If `Ok`, we tell `parse()` to just return the number. If there's an `Err`, no matter what it is, we just `continue` on. Now the program will never break... well, we'll see.

# Common programming concepts in Rust

## Variables and mutability

Good explanation of the tradeoff of immutability: with large data structures, constantly making new immutable versions may be expensive performance-wise; however, the code is easier to reason about. With small data structures it's a no brainer: the performance cost is worth it.

Variables in Rust are immutable by default, but Rust also supports _constants_. Constants cannot be made mutable. They are declared via _const_, and the type must be specified.

```rust
const MAX_POINTS: u32 = 100_000;
```

Constants can be declared in any scope, including global scope: good for globally used values. They cannot be assigned as the result of a function call, or any compute value. In other words, you need to know what the constant is going to be from the moment you write it.

Constants also endure for the length of your program. They use the uppercase style seen above. So they're a great fit for unchanging values that multiple parts of your app needs to know about.

Rust also supports something called _shadowing_. Here's an example:

```rust
fn main() {
    let x = 5;

    let x = x + 1;

    let x = x * 2;

    println!("The value of x is: {}", x);
}
```

We overwrite `x`, an immutable variable, by repeating the `let` keyword. This means we can perform a few transformations, but still end up with an immutable variable.

This essentially creates a new variable, but with the same name.

By shadowing, you can change a variable's type, which is not allowed for mutable variables (they must always stay the same type). Here's an example:

```rust
let spaces = "   ";
let spaces = spaces.len();
```

The Rust book claims this is superior to having to name `spaces_str` and `spaces_num`. Is it? I'm not convinced, yet. Seems somewhat dangerous. What if you forget you have an existing variable and accidentally shadow it?

## Data types

Scalar types: integers, floats, booleans, and characters.

Compound types: tuples and arrays.

With integers, they can be 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, or arch in size. Arch depends on the architecture you're using: 64-bit or 32-bit.

An integers can be signed or unsigned. Unsigned means it cannot be negative. Signed means we also need to store info about whether it's positive or negative.

So you end up with the following integer types: i8, i16, i32, i64, i128, isize, u8, u16, u32, u64, u128, usize.

The default type is `i32`, a good choice most of the time. You might use `isize` or `usize` when indexing a collection, to get the best performance from the architecture.

For floats, it's just `f32` or `f64`, defaulting to `f64`.

For booleans, it's real simple:

```rust
let t = true;

let f: bool = false;
```

You don't need the type declaration, but can add it.

The char type is used for a single character, declared with single quotes (vs string literals, which are double quotes):

```rust
fn main() {
    let c = 'z';
    let z = 'â„¤';
    let heart_eyed_cat = 'ðŸ˜»';
}
```

Tuples are a fixed-length grouping of variables. Each position has a specific type. 

```rust
fn main() {
    let tup: (i32, f64, u8) = (500, 6.4, 1);
}
```

You can use type inference, as well. Here's how you access values:

```rust
fn main() {
    let tup = (500, 6.4, 1);

    let (x, y, z) = tup;

    println!("The value of y is: {}", y);
}
```

Another way to access:

```rust
fn main() {
    let x: (i32, f64, u8) = (500, 6.4, 1);

    let five_hundred = x.0;

    let six_point_four = x.1;

    let one = x.2;
}
```

Arrays are also fixed-length, and must all be the same type.

```rust
let a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
```

Arrays are allocated to the stack instead of the heap. Most of the time, you'll want to use a vector (a type provided by the standard library) instead of an array, since a vector can grow or shrink in size. 

Arrays are good for when the length isn't going to change. 

Here's how you'd declare the type:

```rust
let a: [i32; 5] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
```

This means this array has five elements of type `i32`.

You can also create an array of a certain length with all the same values:

```rust
let a = [3; 5];
```

This will create an array that is `[3,3,3,3,3]`.

Array access is just `a[0]`.

If you try to access an index outside the array's length, Rust will panic and throw a runtime error. Apparently, many low-level languages will let you access invalid memory in this situation: good job, Rust.

## Functions

Snake case, baby. 

```rust
fn another_function() {
    println!("Another function.");
}
```

You can define and call your functions in any order in the same file; it doesn't matter to Rust.

Here it is with parameters:

```rust
fn main() {
    another_function(5);
}

fn another_function(x: i32) {
    println!("The value of x is: {}", x);
}
```

Function signatures require type declarations! All arguments must have their types defined.

Note that statements in Rust do not return values. So in Ruby, you might do:

```ruby
x = y = 2
```

And in JavaScript you might do:

```js
const x = function() { console.log('Function') };
```

Well, in Rust, neither of those work. Statements do not return values, but expressions do.

`5 + 6` is an expression. Calling a function is an expression. Calling a macro is an expression.

Here's a more complex example of an expression:

```rust
fn main() {
    let x = 5;

    let y = {
        let x = 3;
        x + 1
    };

    println!("The value of y is: {}", y);
}
```

This part is an expression, which evaluates to 4:

```rust 
{
    let x = 3;
    x + 1
}
```

Thus, we can assign it to `y`. 

Note the tricky thing here: `x + 1` does not end in a semicolon! Expressions do not have semicolons. If you add one there, it becomes a statement, and doesn't return a value. Tricky tricky.

To have a function return a value, we need to declare the return type and add an expression to the body:

```rust
fn five() -> i32 {
    5
}
```

Another example:

```rust
fn main() {
    let x = plus_one(5);

    println!("The value of x is: {}", x);
}

fn plus_one(x: i32) -> i32 {
    x + 1
}
```

Note that if we changed `x + 1` to `x + 1;`, we'd get an error. The function no longer returns an `i32`. The actual error would say mismatched type, since statements evalute to `()`, an empty tuple, so that would be our return value.
