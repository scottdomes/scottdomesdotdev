_You can read the Rust book in full [here](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/title-page.html)_.

# Getting Started

You can run `rustup doc` to access the documentation, even when offline.

Make a hello world via the following:

```rust
// main.rs
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, world!");
}
```

Then run:

```bash
rustc main.rs
./main
```

You can run `rustfmt` from the command line to format files. [This](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rust-lang.rust) is a VS Code extension for Rust projects, whereas [this one](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=statiolake.vscode-rustfmt) works for single files.

_Macros_ are invoked like `println!("Hello world!")` whereas functions are invoked without the exclamation mark. More on those later.

Rust is a compiled language, which means you compile a binary that anyone can then run (even without Rust installed). Running is thus two steps: compiling and running, vs how it is one step for dynamic languages like JavaScript, Ruby.

Cargo is Rust's build system and package manager. Its config file is written in TOML, which stands for Tom's Obvious, Minimal Language. Great name.

Best practice is to initialize a new Rust project via `cargo new my_project`.

To build a cargo project, run the following:

```bash
cargo build
./target/debug/my_project
```

Or you can just use:

```bash
cargo run
```

If you want to just see if it compiles correctly, run:

```bash
cargo check
```

To make an optimized release build, run:

```bash
cargo build --release
```

# Programming a guessing game

To import a package (in this case the `io` package from the standard library), use:

```rust
use std::io;
```

Certain parts of the standard library are always imported, and known as [the prelude](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/prelude/index.html).

Rust variables are immutable by default (nice). To make one:

```rust
let foo = 5;
```

Make it mutable:

```rust
let mut foo = 5;
```

In the below code:

```rust
let mut string = String::new();
```

... we're calling the `new` associated function on the String type. An associated function belongs to a type, not an instance. AKA a static method.

Many functions can return a `Result` type. `Result` types are enums, with either the value of `Ok` or `Err`.

If you want an `Err` Result to crash your program with a useful message, you can use `expect`. Here's an example of reading the user's CLI and showing a message on a failure:

```rust
io::stdin()
    .read_line(&mut guess)
    .expect("Failed to read line");
```

(`&mut guess` is declaring a mutable reference. More on those later.)

Unhandled Results will result in a warning at compile time. (`expect` isn't really "handling" the error, per se, but it will suppress the warning; if you write `expect`, you want the program to crash when the `Result` is wrong.)

You can do string interpolation like so:

```rust
let x = 5;
let y = 10;

println!("x = {} and y = {}", x, y);
```

Rust calls packages "crates". Your project is a "binary crate"; it's meant to be executed. Packages you use in your project are "library crates"; they're meant to be used by other programs.

To add a dependency, modify `Cargo.toml` like so:

```toml
[dependencies]
rand = "0.5.5"
```

You can view crates via [Crates.io](https://crates.io/).

Your crate versions will stay the same thanks to `Cargo.lock`. To upgrade all your packages, run `cargo update`. Note that this will only upgrade minor version. `0.5.5` will become `0.5.6`, but never `0.6.0`; you have to manually upgrade to `0.6.0` via `Cargo.toml`.

Here's another example of importing and using a crate:

```rust
use rand::Rng;

let secret_number = rand::thread_rng().gen_range(1, 101);
```

We import the `Rng` trait of the `rand` crate; that must be in scope to allow us to use methods related to random number generators. We then call the `rng::thread_rng` function that gives us a random number generator that is local to the current thread. Then we call its `gen_range` method.

To see documentation for YOUR dependencies, run `cargo doc --open`. Pretty neat.

The `cmp` method can be used to compare two things, for example:

```rust
"abc".cmp("cde")
```

The result of a `cmp` will be variant of the `Ordering` enum (imported with `use std::cmp::Ordering`). The variants are `Less`, `Equal`, and `Greater`.

You can combine the `Ordering` enum with a `match` statement. A `match` statement decides what to do based on which variant is returned. Here's an example:

```rust
match "abc".cmp("abc") {
    Ordering::Less => println!("Smaller!"),
    Ordering::Greater => println!("Bigger!"),
    Ordering::Equal => println!("Equal!"),
}
```

`match` checks each "arm" and sees if the returned variant matches; if yes, it executes that code. Here, it would print "Equal!" In the next code snippet, it would print "Smaller!"

```rust
match 1.cmp(&2) {
    Ordering::Less => println!("Smaller!"),
    Ordering::Greater => println!("Bigger!"),
    Ordering::Equal => println!("Equal!"),
}
```

(The `&` is due to 2 needing to be a reference; more on that later.)

Rust is strongly typed, with type inference. In the below code, Rust is smart enough to guess the variable is a string:

```rust
let mut guess = String::new();
```

Here's an example of converting one type to another. Say that `guess` ends up being a number in string form, like `'23'`. We can convert it to a 32-bit number type like so:

```rust
let guess: u32 = guess.trim().parse().expect("Please type a number!");
```

We trim the whitespace, parse the number, and throw a descriptive error if that fails. We also clearly declare the type of the variable. If we didn't specify `u32`, Rust wouldn't know what kind of number to return from `parse()`.

To create an infinite loop, enclose code in a `loop {}`. You can then use `break` to escape it.

To properly handle errors, you can move from an `expect` call to a `match` expression. Here's an example:

```rust
let guess: u32 = match guess.trim().parse() {
    Ok(num) => num,
    Err(_) => continue,
};
```

If `Ok`, we tell `parse()` to just return the number. If there's an `Err`, no matter what it is, we just `continue` on. Now the program will never break... well, we'll see.

# Common programming concepts in Rust

## Variables and mutability

Good explanation of the tradeoff of immutability: with large data structures, constantly making new immutable versions may be expensive performance-wise; however, the code is easier to reason about. With small data structures it's a no brainer: the performance cost is worth it.

Variables in Rust are immutable by default, but Rust also supports _constants_. Constants cannot be made mutable. They are declared via _const_, and the type must be specified.

```rust
const MAX_POINTS: u32 = 100_000;
```

Constants can be declared in any scope, including global scope: good for globally used values. They cannot be assigned as the result of a function call, or any compute value. In other words, you need to know what the constant is going to be from the moment you write it.

Constants also endure for the length of your program. They use the uppercase style seen above. So they're a great fit for unchanging values that multiple parts of your app needs to know about.

Rust also supports something called _shadowing_. Here's an example:

```rust
fn main() {
    let x = 5;

    let x = x + 1;

    let x = x * 2;

    println!("The value of x is: {}", x);
}
```

We overwrite `x`, an immutable variable, by repeating the `let` keyword. This means we can perform a few transformations, but still end up with an immutable variable.

This essentially creates a new variable, but with the same name.

By shadowing, you can change a variable's type, which is not allowed for mutable variables (they must always stay the same type). Here's an example:

```rust
let spaces = "   ";
let spaces = spaces.len();
```

The Rust book claims this is superior to having to name `spaces_str` and `spaces_num`. Is it? I'm not convinced, yet. Seems somewhat dangerous. What if you forget you have an existing variable and accidentally shadow it?

## Data types

Scalar types: integers, floats, booleans, and characters.

Compound types: tuples and arrays.

With integers, they can be 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, or arch in size. Arch depends on the architecture you're using: 64-bit or 32-bit.

An integers can be signed or unsigned. Unsigned means it cannot be negative. Signed means we also need to store info about whether it's positive or negative.

So you end up with the following integer types: i8, i16, i32, i64, i128, isize, u8, u16, u32, u64, u128, usize.

The default type is `i32`, a good choice most of the time. You might use `isize` or `usize` when indexing a collection, to get the best performance from the architecture.

For floats, it's just `f32` or `f64`, defaulting to `f64`.

For booleans, it's real simple:

```rust
let t = true;

let f: bool = false;
```

You don't need the type declaration, but can add it.

The char type is used for a single character, declared with single quotes (vs string literals, which are double quotes):

```rust
fn main() {
    let c = 'z';
    let z = 'â„¤';
    let heart_eyed_cat = 'ðŸ˜»';
}
```

Tuples are a fixed-length grouping of variables. Each position has a specific type. 

```rust
fn main() {
    let tup: (i32, f64, u8) = (500, 6.4, 1);
}
```

You can use type inference, as well. Here's how you access values:

```rust
fn main() {
    let tup = (500, 6.4, 1);

    let (x, y, z) = tup;

    println!("The value of y is: {}", y);
}
```

Another way to access:

```rust
fn main() {
    let x: (i32, f64, u8) = (500, 6.4, 1);

    let five_hundred = x.0;

    let six_point_four = x.1;

    let one = x.2;
}
```

Arrays are also fixed-length, and must all be the same type.

```rust
let a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
```

Arrays are allocated to the stack instead of the heap. Most of the time, you'll want to use a vector (a type provided by the standard library) instead of an array, since a vector can grow or shrink in size. 

Arrays are good for when the length isn't going to change. 

Here's how you'd declare the type:

```rust
let a: [i32; 5] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
```

This means this array has five elements of type `i32`.

You can also create an array of a certain length with all the same values:

```rust
let a = [3; 5];
```

This will create an array that is `[3,3,3,3,3]`.

Array access is just `a[0]`.

If you try to access an index outside the array's length, Rust will panic and throw a runtime error. Apparently, many low-level languages will let you access invalid memory in this situation: good job, Rust.

## Functions

Snake case, baby. 

```rust
fn another_function() {
    println!("Another function.");
}
```

You can define and call your functions in any order in the same file; it doesn't matter to Rust.

Here it is with parameters:

```rust
fn main() {
    another_function(5);
}

fn another_function(x: i32) {
    println!("The value of x is: {}", x);
}
```

Function signatures require type declarations! All arguments must have their types defined.

Note that statements in Rust do not return values. So in Ruby, you might do:

```ruby
x = y = 2
```

And in JavaScript you might do:

```js
const x = function() { console.log('Function') };
```

Well, in Rust, neither of those work. Statements do not return values, but expressions do.

`5 + 6` is an expression. Calling a function is an expression. Calling a macro is an expression.

Here's a more complex example of an expression:

```rust
fn main() {
    let x = 5;

    let y = {
        let x = 3;
        x + 1
    };

    println!("The value of y is: {}", y);
}
```

This part is an expression, which evaluates to 4:

```rust 
{
    let x = 3;
    x + 1
}
```

Thus, we can assign it to `y`. 

Note the tricky thing here: `x + 1` does not end in a semicolon! Expressions do not have semicolons. If you add one there, it becomes a statement, and doesn't return a value. Tricky tricky.

To have a function return a value, we need to declare the return type and add an expression to the body:

```rust
fn five() -> i32 {
    5
}
```

Another example:

```rust
fn main() {
    let x = plus_one(5);

    println!("The value of x is: {}", x);
}

fn plus_one(x: i32) -> i32 {
    x + 1
}
```

Note that if we changed `x + 1` to `x + 1;`, we'd get an error. The function no longer returns an `i32`. The actual error would say mismatched type, since statements evalute to `()`, an empty tuple, so that would be our return value. 

## Comments

```rust
// Comments are easy
```

## Control flow

The following won't work:

```rust
fn main() {
    let number = 3;

    if number {
        println!("number was three");
    }
}
```

Values are not coerced to booleans. Instead, do:

```rust
fn main() {
    let number = 3;

    if number == 3 {
        println!("number was three");
    }
}
```

Multiple conditions:

```rust
fn main() {
    let number = 6;

    if number % 4 == 0 {
        println!("number is divisible by 4");
    } else if number % 3 == 0 {
        println!("number is divisible by 3");
    } else if number % 2 == 0 {
        println!("number is divisible by 2");
    } else {
        println!("number is not divisible by 4, 3, or 2");
    }
}
```

Since `if` is an expression, you can assign it to a variable, and do a ternary:

```rust
let condition = true;
let number = if condition { 5 } else { 6 };
```

... but they must be the same type. The following would throw an error:

```rust
let condition = true;
let number = if condition { 5 } else { "six" };
```

Rust has three types of loops: `loop`, `while`, `for`. Here's how you might print every item in an array:

```rust
fn main() {
    let a = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50];
    let mut index = 0;

    while index < 5 {
        println!("the value is: {}", a[index]);

        index += 1;
    }
}
```

A more concise version using `for`:

```rust
fn main() {
    let a = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50];

    for element in a.iter() {
        println!("the value is: {}", element);
    }
}
```

Just for fun, here's a countdown:

```rust
fn main() {
    for number in (1..4).rev() {
        println!("{}!", number);
    }
    println!("LIFTOFF!!!");
}
```

# Ownership

A unique feature to Rust. It allows Rust to have memory safety without a garbage collector. 

Other languages use one of two options for managing memory:

1. A garbage collector trolls about for memory that is no longer needed.
2. The programmer explicitly allocates and frees memory.

## Refresher on stack & heap

Whether a value is stored on stack or heap matters in Rust. Here's what each means:

Stack stores value in last in, first out. Like a stack of plates. All data must be of fixed size. You _push on_ data and then _pop off_ when you need it.

Heap stores values by address, which is called a pointer. Requesting a certain amount of memory and getting a pointer back is called _allocating_. To get your data, follow the pointer.

The stack is faster, since you don't have to find a place: you just push it onto the stack. When you call a function, its values are put onto the stack for fast access, and then popped off when you're done.

Managing the heap is the goal of garbage collectors (in other languages) and ownership rules (in Rust). We want to avoid duplicate data and clean up unused data.

## Back to ownership

Here are the three rules of ownership:

"Each value in Rust has a variable thatâ€™s called its owner.
There can only be one owner at a time.
When the owner goes out of scope, the value will be dropped."

Here's an example of scope:

```rust
fn main() { // s is not valid here
  let s = "hello"; // s becomes valid

  // s is valid here
} // scope over, s no longer valid
```

The above is a string literal, which are immutable. If you want a mutable string, use `String`:

```rust
let string = String::from("hello");
```

More on Strings later, but first, a question: why is a string literal immutable, and a String mutable? 

A string literal is immutable because its size is known at compile time: it becomes hardcoded into the final executable. Since a String is mutable, we need to allocate memory in the heap for it, instead. 

That implies allocating the memory, and then freeing it once we're done with our String.

In Rust, that memory is automatically freed when our String goes out of scope. When our variable `string` goes out of scope, Rust calls a function called `drop` behind the scenes (this happens at the last curly bracket of the scope). This frees up the memory.

So the variable `string` "owns" the memory used to store `"hello"`, and once it is out of scope, that memory is free.

Here's an example of allocation with a String:

```rust
let s1 = String::from("hello");
let s2 = s1;
```

When `s1` is created, behind the scenes it is composed of three things:

1. Length (in this case, 5)
2. Capacity (also 5)
3. A pointer to the memory in the heap where it is stored

(Length is how much memory the string is using, capacity is how much has been allocated to it.)

`s2` has the same length, capacity, and pointer. No new memory needs to be allocated, which is efficient.

But the downside is that `s1` and `s2` have the same pointer, so when they are `drop`ped, you would normally get what's called a "double free" error: trying to free the same memory twice.

So to avoid this, Rust does something sneaky: it invalidates `s1`. If you try to use it like so...

```rust
let s1 = String::from("hello");
let s2 = s1;

println!("{}, world!", s1);
```

... you get a "borrow of moved value" error. The pointer has been moved from `s1` to `s2`, so `s1` is useless now: it is effectively out of the scope.

If you _did_ want to properly _copy_ `s1`, and create a new pointer in memory for `s2`, you can use the `clone` method:

```rust
let s1 = String::from("hello");
let s2 = s1.clone();

println!("s1 = {}, s2 = {}", s1, s2);
```

This works just fine.

Now, there are some exceptions to this. Things like integers are of fixed size and thus cheap to copy, so Rust does it automatically. E.g. the below code works fine:

```rust
let x = 5;
let y = x;

println!("x = {}, y = {}", x, y);
```

Behind the scenes, it does the same thing as:

```rust
let x = 5;
let y = x.clone();

println!("x = {}, y = {}", x, y);
```

Integers possess a trait called `Copy` that drives this behaviour, which you can add to your own types. `Copy` types are stored entirely on the stack. Other types that are automatically `Copy`-ed:

- all integers
- booleans
- floats
- chars 
- tuples of `Copy` types

Ownership also means values can "move" into functions:

```rust
fn main() {
    let s = String::from("hello");  // s is stored in heap

    takes_ownership(s);  // s's value moves into the function...
    // s can no longer be used in this scope
}

fn some_function(some_string: String) { // some_string comes into scope
    println!("{}", some_string);
} // some_string goes out of scope, is dropped, and memory in heap is freed
```

Again, it's different with integers and other `Copy` types:

```rust
fn main() {
    let x = 5;  // x is stored in stack

    takes_ownership(x);  // x's value moves into the function...
    // but since x is Copy, it can still be used here
}

fn some_function(some_number: i32) { // some_number comes into scope
    println!("{}", some_string);
} // some_number goes out of scope, but nothing happens
```

When it comes to functions and return values, it's a little complicated. Here's an annotated example:

```rust
fn main() {
  let s1 = generates_a_string(); // the return value of this function is moved to s1
} // s1 goes out of scope and is dropped

fn generates_a_string() {
  let some_string = String::from("hello"); // some_string comes into scope

  some_string // some_string is returned and moves out of scope
}
```

In the above example, you have a string that is created in one scope, moves to another, and then is dropped.

Here's another example:

```rust
fn main() {
  let string1 = String::from("hello"); // A string with the value of "hello" is created

  let string2 = takes_ownership(string1) // string1 is passed out of scope. The return value of takes_ownership is moved into string2
} // string1 goes out of scope, but it was already moved to string2, so nothing happens. string2 is dropped.

fn takes_and_returns(a_string: String) -> String {
  a_string // the string is returned and moved to the calling function
}
```

Here, we're only dealing with one value: a string that says "hello". That data is attached to a variable called `string1`, then moved to the second function and called `a_string`, then moved BACK to the first function and called `string2`, until it is finally dropped. Ownership is transferred, but the underlying value (and its place in memory) is the same.

Now, you might see a problem here. What if you want to pass a variable to a function, but then use it again? You'd have to be careful to pass ownership back, which could be painful. Here's one example of that painful route using a tuple:

```rust
fn main() {
    let s1 = String::from("hello");

    let (s2, len) = calculate_length(s1);

    println!("The length of '{}' is {}.", s2, len);
}

fn calculate_length(s: String) -> (String, usize) {
    let length = s.len(); // len() returns the length of a String

    (s, length)
}
```

We pass in the string, get its length, but we have to make sure to get both the string itself and the length back from the function, if we want to use the string again. Blah. Good thing Rust has us covered, with...

## References

Here's the really simple fix for the above:

```rust
fn main() {
    let s1 = String::from("hello");

    let len = calculate_length(&s1);

    println!("The length of '{}' is {}.", s1, len);
}

fn calculate_length(s: &String) -> usize {
    s.len()
}
```

The `&` implies that `s1` is a reference, which is essentially a temporary loan to the `calculate_length` function. What is actually happening is that the `s` parameter in `calculate_length` has a pointer that points to the `s1` variable, which in turn points to the actual value in memory.

Note that you need the `&String` type in the declaration for `calculate_length` to be clear it is a reference.

This whole process is called _borrowing_. Makes sense.

You cannot modify a borrowed value. `calculate_length` could not change the string. Don't mess with stuff you borrowed. References are immutable. Except when they aren't.

Yes, you can have mutable references.

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut s = String::from("hello");

    change(&mut s);
}

fn change(some_string: &mut String) {
    some_string.push_str(", world");
}
```

Note you have to put `mut` three times: when we declare the variable, and when we pass it as a reference, and when we declare the function parameter.

But to keep things sane, you can only have one mutable reference per variable in a given scope. This code will cause an error `cannot borrow `s` as mutable more than once at a time`:

```rust
let mut s = String::from("hello");

let r1 = &mut s;
let r2 = &mut s;

println!("{}, {}", r1, r2);
```

The problem Rust is trying to prevent here is called a `data race`, where multiple pointers have read/write access to a value; what happens if one writes while the other reads, simultaneously?

A couple more scenarios with mutable/immutable references. This code is okay: we have multiple mutable references, but they're in different scopes:

```rust
let mut s = String::from("hello");

{
    let r1 = &mut s;
} // r1 goes out of scope here, so we can make a new reference with no problems.

let r2 = &mut s;
```

This code is bad, as you cannot have both immutable and mutable references to the same variable:

```rust
let mut s = String::from("hello");

let r1 = &s; // no problem
let r2 = &s; // no problem
let r3 = &mut s; // BIG PROBLEM

println!("{}, {}, and {}", r1, r2, r3);
```

So, in short, you have to choose. You can have one or multiple immutable references, OR one mutable reference (per scope).

Let's complicate it _a little_ more. A reference's scope starts from where it is declared, and _ends when it is last used_. That means you can do this:

```rust
let mut s = String::from("hello");

let r1 = &s; // no problem
let r2 = &s; // no problem
println!("{} and {}", r1, r2);
// r1 and r2 are no longer used after this point

let r3 = &mut s; // no problem
println!("{}", r3);
```

If we changed this code to use `r1` or `r2` after the last line, THEN we'd have a problem.

Rust will throw an error if a reference is allowed to persist when the value it points to has gone out of scope. For example:

```rust
fn main() {
    let reference = get_bad_reference() // We receive a reference
}

fn get_bad_reference() -> &String {
    let string = String::from("hello");

    &string // We return a reference to string
} // But string goes out of scope here! Its memory is gone.
```

(To fix this problem, return `string` itself, not a reference, which will move ownership out of that scope.)

## The slice type

If you had the string "hello world", and you only wanted to reference the "world" part, you could use a _string slice._

```rust
let s = String::from("hello world");

let hello = &s[0..5];
let world = &s[6..11];
```

In this case, the `world` variable's pointer is to the 7th byte of the string. `s` variable's pointer is to the 0th byte.

Note that `world` doesn't point to the `s` variable; it points to the underlying memory, same as `s`. 

You can drop the numbers that refer to the first and last character, for convenience:

```rust
let hello = &s[..5];
let world = &s[6..];
```

To take the entire string, you can do:

```rust
let hello_world = &s[..]
```

Slices are immutable references. There's an interesting consequence to this. Behold the following code, which will fail:

```rust
let mut s = String::from("hello world");

let hello = &s[..5];
s.clear();
```

To call `clear()` (which empties the string), Rust needs to create a mutable reference first. But `hello` is already an _immutable_ reference, and as we learned, you can't have an immutable reference and a mutable reference at the same time. This is good, because it protects `hello` from trying to access an empty string.

String literals, like the one below, are slices. What does this mean? Well, look at it first:

```rust
let s = "Hello, world!";
```

Since the string is hardcoded into the binary, `s` is actually a reference. It points to the specific location of the string in the binary. Thus, it is an immutable reference.

You can also slice arrays:

```rust
let a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

let slice = &a[1..3];
```

For reference, the type of `slice` is `&[i32]`. It's a reference to an array of integer values, pointing to a specific byte.

# Structs

To make a struct, you define it, then instantiate it:

```rust
// Define:
struct User {
    username: String,
    email: String,
    sign_in_count: u64,
    active: bool,
}

// Instantiate:
let mut user1 = User {
    email: String::from("someone@example.com"),
    username: String::from("someusername123"),
    active: true,
    sign_in_count: 1,
};
```

Since in this case the instance is `mut`able, we can do this:

```rust
user1.email = String::from("anotheremail@example.com");
```

You can't have immutable fields and mutable fields in the same instance: either it's all mutable, or none of it is.

Here's a function that returns an instance:

```rust
fn build_user(email: String, username: String) -> User {
    User {
        email: email,
        username: username,
        active: true,
        sign_in_count: 1,
    }
}
```

You can also use this shorthand (called _field init shorthand_):

```rust
fn build_user(email: String, username: String) -> User {
    User {
        email,
        username,
        active: true,
        sign_in_count: 1,
    }
}
```

Use the `..` syntax to create new instances based on old instances:

```rust
let user2 = User {
    email: String::from("another@example.com"),
    username: String::from("anotherusername567"),
    ..user1
};
```

## Tuple structs

Let's start with an example:

```rust
struct Color(i32, i32, i32);
struct Point(i32, i32, i32);

let black = Color(0, 0, 0);
let origin = Point(0, 0, 0);
```

`Color` and `Point` are structs, but they contain values without keys, like tuples. This is allowed. The advantage here is that the type of `black` is `Color`. If you had a function that only takes the `Color` type, you could not pass it a `Point` type.

Other than their types, tuple structs behave like tuples.

Structs can store references, but this involves the use of _lifetimes_, something we'll cover later.

To print out a struct, you need to add the debug annotation:

```rust
#[derive(Debug)]
struct Rectangle {
    width: u32,
    height: u32,
}

fn main() {
    let rect1 = Rectangle {
        width: 30,
        height: 50,
    };

    println!("rect1 is {:?}", rect1);
}
```

This will yield:

```bash
$ cargo run
   Compiling structs v0.1.0 (file:///projects/structs)
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.48s
     Running `target/debug/structs`
rect1 is Rectangle { width: 30, height: 50 }
```

If you swapped the `{:?}` for `{:#}`, you'd get:

```bash
$ cargo run
   Compiling structs v0.1.0 (file:///projects/structs)
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.48s
     Running `target/debug/structs`
rect1 is Rectangle {
    width: 30,
    height: 50,
}
```

## Struct method syntax

Methods are functions that are defined within the context of a struct (or enum or trait object); their first parameter is always self, which refers to the instance.

To define a method, you must define the struct and then implement the method:

```rust
struct Rectangle {
    width: u32,
    height: u32,
}

impl Rectangle {
    fn area(&self) -> u32 {
        self.width * self.height
    }
}
```

To invoke a method:

```
rect1.area();
```

If you wanted your method to mutate the instance, you'd have to specify `&mut self` as the parameter.

You can also have the method take ownership of `self` (and not use a reference), but that's rare.

To implement multiple methods, put them in the same `impl` block:

```rust
impl Rectangle {
    fn area(&self) -> u32 {
        self.width * self.height
    }

    fn can_hold(&self, other: &Rectangle) -> bool {
        self.width > other.width && self.height > other.height
    }
}
```

You can also write this in multiple `impl` blocks, though it's uglier:

```rust
impl Rectangle {
    fn area(&self) -> u32 {
        self.width * self.height
    }
}

impl Rectangle {
    fn can_hold(&self, other: &Rectangle) -> bool {
        self.width > other.width && self.height > other.height
    }
}
```

## Associated functions

You can also do this:

```rust
impl Rectangle {
    fn square(size: u32) -> Rectangle {
        Rectangle {
            width: size,
            height: size,
        }
    }
}
```

... but since `square` does not receive `self` as an argument, it's not a method. It's called an associated function, and you invoke it via `Rectangle::square(3);`. It's like a class method in Ruby.
