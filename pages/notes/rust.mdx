*You can read the Rust book in full [here](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/title-page.html)*.

# Getting Started

You can run `rustup doc` to access the documentation, even when offline.

Make a hello world via the following:

```rust
// main.rs
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, world!");
}
```

Then run: 

```bash
rustc main.rs
./main
```

You can run `rustfmt` from the command line to format files. [This](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rust-lang.rust) is a VS Code extension for Rust projects, whereas [this one](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=statiolake.vscode-rustfmt) works for single files.

*Macros* are invoked like `println!("Hello world!")` whereas functions are invoked without the exclamation mark. More on those later.

Rust is a compiled language, which means you compile a binary that anyone can then run (even without Rust installed). Running is thus two steps: compiling and running, vs how it is one step for dynamic languages like JavaScript, Ruby.

Cargo is Rust's build system and package manager. Its config file is written in TOML, which stands for Tom's Obvious, Minimal Language. Great name.

Best practice is to initialize a new Rust project via `cargo new my_project`.

To build a cargo project, run the following:

```bash
cargo build
./target/debug/my_project
```

Or you can just use:

```bash
cargo run
```

If you want to just see if it compiles correctly, run:

```bash
cargo check
```

To make an optimized release build, run:

```bash
cargo build --release
```
